On Mac OS X, compile with:
g++ -dynamiclib -flat_namespace myclass.cc -o myclass.so
g++ class_user.cc -o class_user

On Linux, compile with:
g++ -fPIC -shared myclass.cc -o myclass.so
g++ class_user.cc -ldl -o class_user

If this were for a plugin system, you would use MyClass as a base class and define all the required functions virtual.
The plugin author would then derive from MyClass, override the virtuals and implement create_object and destroy_object.
Your main application would not need to be changed in any way.
